Introduction: Alcohol consumption among young people is a growing public health problem associated with psychological changes that affect well-being and social functioning. In Las Casuarinas – Piura, there has been a progressive increase in consumption behaviors that can negatively influence the mental health of young people.
Materials and Methods: A quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional study was conducted to analyze the association between alcohol consumption and the mental health of young people living on three streets in Las Casuarinas. The population consisted of 42 young people, from which a probabilistic sample of 38 participants was selected. Two Likert-type questionnaires were applied: one based on the dimensions of alcohol consumption proposed by the World Health Organization and the other based on Ryff's psychological well-being model and the WHO's mental health criteria. Validity was established by expert judgment, with Aiken's V values between 0.82 and 0.89, and reliability was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, reaching 0.70 and 0.80.
Results: Descriptive analyses identified different levels of alcohol consumption and variations in mental health indicators. The coexistence of moderate consumption patterns and reduced psychological well-being was observed.
Conclusions: The results suggest a relationship between alcohol consumption and the mental health status of the young people evaluated. These findings provide a basis for future research and preventive strategies.
